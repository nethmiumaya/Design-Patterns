# Design Patterns in Software Development

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** repository!  
This project contains practical examples and implementations of commonly used design patterns in software engineering, with a focus on understanding their real-world usage and benefits.

## 🧠 What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems. They are best practices refined through years of experience in software development. This repository explores **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** design patterns.

- **Command**  
- **Chain of Responsibility**  
- **State**  
- **Template Method**
